A Windows application to do some basic ASCOM control of your telescope. Intgrates with ASCOM 6 so you'll need to download/install that first. I mainly use this to automatically set my mount time to the system time of my imaging laptop. I also use it to park my scope at the end of the session to pre-defined Alt-Az coordinates.
